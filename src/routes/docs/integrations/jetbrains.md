# JetBrains

Gitpod isn't only a browser-based IDE, or 'VS Code in the browser'. In line with our goal to "remove all friction from the developer experience" we want to integrate many different IDE's. Integrating every IDE isn't always possible, though, as the IDE has to support remote development and/or run in a browser. Luckily, though, our friends at [Jetbrains are very close](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455) to allow connecting to your remote Gitpod workspace from your favourite Desktop Jetbrains IDE.

## Jetbrains' Desktop IDEs

Soon, we will be rolling out a private beta for Jetbrains Desktop IDEs. If you're interested to be part of the private beta group, [leave us a  comment in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6342) and we'll reach out to you.

## Jetbrains Projector
